A cow clicker. I always wanted to write one.
Deployed at https://cow.kosta.io/

## Features

* You can click the cow. Currently, everyone shares the same cow.

## Planned Features

* Multiple named cows

## Known issues

* Hovering & clicking the cow is not exact: Anywhere in the transparent png
  counts as well.
